# FullStackDev

This repository was created for the various submissions required in the Full Stack Developer course offered by the University of Helsinki.

Welcome to my Full Stack Dev. exercise repository! Here, you'll find all the exercises, practices, and projects I've completed throughout the course, organized by parts/modules.
